[Handling message semantics with Generic Broadcast protocols.pdf](/articles/Handling%20message%20semantics%20with%20Generic%20Broadcast%20protocols.pdf) | Proposes an alternative to the atomic broadcasting algorithm by focussing on semantically conflicting messages: Messages that don't conflict don't need to have consensus properties. This results in better performance| 10%, stopped, reading [Thrifty generic broadcast.pdf](/articles/Thrifty%20generic%20broadcast.pdf) | [Thrifty generic broadcast.pdf](/articles/Thrifty%20generic%20broadcast.pdf)  |
